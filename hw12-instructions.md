Due Thursday, March 03, 2016  Rails CRUD
IronLibrary: Basic CRUD, on Heroku
We will be building and enhancing on the IronLibary for the remainder of the cohort.
We start with the base objectives of a library: Books. We will build upon this throughout the cohort.

Delivery
Turn in both a link to the GitHub Repo and the Heroku instance.

Normal Mode
Create a Rails application which can manage (CRUD) a collection of books, each with an Author. A Book will have a title, a photo_url, a price. The Author should have a first_name, last_name, and a bio.
You should be able to manage the books, select an author
It should be styled with Bootstrap or Materialize.
For the README.md, add screenshots, an MIT LICENSE, and a description of what the app can do.
Deploy the application to Heroku.
Epic Mode
Research the mechanize gem, which enables you to scrape a webpage. Then, scrape the best selling books of 2015/2016 from http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2015/books/ and build your Bookshelf from it.
